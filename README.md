## Contents of Paper
This paper Ranks the MLB teams based off their 2021 season data. The paper includes why the Page Rank algorithm applies to the sitation, implementing pairwise comparisons of game outcomes as pairwise directed edges representing hyperlinks connecting pages, and predicting the outcome of the 2021 World Series in accordance to sports betting statistical analysts.  

## About this project
The only requirement for this project was that it had to be about the MLB in 2021. Since I just completed a project about the Page Rank algorithm, I realized that it could be used to measure pairwise conflicts between baseball teams. While my team members were hesitant about this being 60% of our grade initially, I liked the odds, and ranked the teams anyways. The results spoke for themselves, and we made most of the paper about baseball. The technical parts sections are fairly qualitative since they were completed first, and served as a form of communication to the rest of the team.
